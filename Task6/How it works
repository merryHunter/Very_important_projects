Click "Create() Demonstrate" and notice assembly's number.
When you click "Add assembly", app load assembly from ...\\Debug directory.
There are dll libraries located in the ...\\bin directory of project, so you only need to copy only one of them into
...\\Debug directory. If loading dll causes exception, try to unblock dll files in their file's property.
After that, try "Create() Demonstrate" again and notice the assembly's number difference. 
There is a background assembly scanning.
